<img src="./images/brad.jpg" alt="Brad Profile Picture">
<p>Hello! My name is Brad and I’m a web designer based in Westborough, MA. I’ve been working on WordPress websites since 2014 when I started up a blog in college called “How To Produce Electronic Music.”

Since then, I’ve learned how to create custom websites with HTML and CSS (which I absolutely LOVE doing). I am a perpetual learner and continue to enhance and sharpen my skills with website design, coding, and UX/UI.

 As the owner of Speed Insight Designs, I’m dedicated to bringing your ideas to life through thoughtfully-designed websites. I bring my best thoughts, past experience, and expertise to help you showcase your brand in the best way possible!

I look forward to working with you soon!

– Brad Bator</p>
